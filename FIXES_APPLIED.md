# BSW Scheduling Agent - Fixes Applied

## Summary
Applied 4 critical fixes to all three specialty agents (Orthopedic, Cardiology, Primary Care) based on user testing feedback.

---

## Fix #1: Post-Op/Follow-Up Referral Logic

### Issue
Agent incorrectly stated that post-operative follow-up appointments require a new referral, even though the original surgery already had referral approval.

### Solution
Updated all three agent prompts to distinguish between:
- **Post-operative/follow-up appointments**: Do NOT require new referral (original procedure already had approval)
- **New appointments/consultations**: Check if referral required based on insurance

### Changes Made

**Orthopedic Agent (prompts.py:251-258)**:
```
**Step 3: Check Insurance & Referrals** (if applicable)
- Use verify_insurance() to check coverage
- **IMPORTANT: Distinguish between appointment types:**
  - **Post-operative follow-ups**: Do NOT require new referral (original surgery already had referral approval)
  - **New appointments/consultations**: Check if referral required based on insurance
- If Blue Cross Blue Shield, Aetna, or Medicaid AND new appointment (not follow-up): Check if referral required
- Use check_referral() if needed for new appointments only
```

**Cardiology Agent (prompts.py:536-543)**:
```
**Step 3: Verify Insurance & Referrals**
- **IMPORTANT: Distinguish between appointment types:**
  - **Post-procedure/post-cardiac event follow-ups**: Do NOT require new referral
  - **New appointments/consultations**: Check if referral required based on insurance
- BCBS, Aetna, Medicaid require referrals for NEW cardiology appointments
- Use check_referral() if needed for new appointments only
```

**Primary Care Agent (prompts.py:799-805)**:
```
**Step 2: Verify Insurance Coverage**
- Important distinction:
  - **Follow-up visits**: Do NOT require new referral (original condition already established)
```

## Fix #2: Same Provider Preference for Follow-Ups

### Issue
Agent was not preferentially suggesting the same surgeon/provider for follow-up appointments, which is standard medical practice for continuity of care.

### Research Finding
According to medical best practices:
- Follow-up visits are vital for postoperative care
- The operating surgeon/provider has intimate knowledge of the procedure
- Continuity of care improves outcomes
- Best practice favors follow-up with same provider when possible

### Solution
Updated all three agents to:
1. Check patient's recent visits to identify the original provider
2. Search for that provider's availability FIRST
3. Only offer alternative providers if original is unavailable or patient requests

### Changes Made

**Orthopedic Agent (prompts.py:260-275)**:
```
**Step 4: Find Appropriate Provider**
- **FOR POST-OPERATIVE FOLLOW-UPS:**
  - Check patient's recent visits (from get_patient_info) to identify the surgeon who performed the surgery
  - **ALWAYS prefer the same surgeon for follow-ups** (continuity of care best practice)
  - Search for that surgeon's availability FIRST
  - Only if the original surgeon is unavailable or patient explicitly requests a different provider:
    - Ask: "Dr. [Original Surgeon] performed your surgery. Would you prefer to follow up with them, or would you like to see a closer provider?"
    - If patient wants different provider, explain: "I can schedule you with another orthopedic surgeon in [Closer City]. They'll have access to your surgical records."
```

**Cardiology Agent (prompts.py:545-560)**:
```
**Step 4: Match to Appropriate Cardiologist**
- **FOR POST-PROCEDURE/POST-CARDIAC EVENT FOLLOW-UPS:**
  - Check patient's recent visits (from get_patient_info) to identify the cardiologist who performed the procedure or managed the cardiac event
  - **ALWAYS prefer the same cardiologist for follow-ups** (continuity of care best practice)
  - Search for that cardiologist's availability FIRST
  - Only if the original cardiologist is unavailable or patient explicitly requests a different provider:
    - Ask: "Dr. [Original Cardiologist] managed your [procedure/event]. Would you prefer to follow up with them, or would you like to see a closer provider?"
```

**Primary Care Agent (prompts.py:807-822)**:
```
**Step 3: Find Appropriate Provider**
- **FOR FOLLOW-UP VISITS:**
  - Check patient's recent visits (from get_patient_info) to identify their established PCP
  - **ALWAYS prefer the same PCP for follow-ups** (continuity of care best practice)
  - Search for that PCP's availability FIRST
  - Only if the PCP is unavailable or patient explicitly requests a different provider:
    - Ask: "Dr. [PCP Name] is your established primary care provider. Would you prefer to follow up with them, or would you like to see a closer provider?"
```

## Fix #3: "No Appointments Available" Issue

### Issue
Agent was saying "no appointments available" without actually searching multiple date ranges, or after only checking a limited time window.

### Solution
Updated all three agents to:
1. Search multiple date ranges (2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks) before claiming no availability
2. Provide actual next available date when patient asks
3. Only escalate to phone support if truly no appointments exist in system

### Changes Made

**All Three Agents - Search Slots Step**:
```
- **CRITICAL**: When patient asks "what's the next available appointment", ACTUALLY search and provide the real next available date
  - If no slots in next 2 weeks, search 4 weeks, then 6 weeks if needed
  - If truly no appointments available, say: "I'm showing no available appointments in the system. Let me transfer you to our scheduling team at 1-844-BSW-DOCS who can check for cancellations or waitlist options."
  - NEVER say "no appointments available" without actually searching multiple date ranges first
```

- Cardiology Agent: prompts.py:562-573
- Primary Care Agent: prompts.py:824-836

## Fix #4: "Hold On For A Moment" Auto-Continuation UX

### Issue
Agent was saying "Please hold on for a moment" or "Let me check..." and then waiting for the user to prompt again, instead of automatically continuing with the function call and presenting results.

### Solution
Updated all three agents to immediately use tools and present results without requiring user to prompt again.

### Changes Made

**All Three Agents - Added to Search Slots Step**:
```
- **DO NOT say "hold on for a moment" or "let me check" and then wait for user to prompt you**
  - Instead, IMMEDIATELY use the tool and present results
  - Example: "Let me search for available appointments..." [uses tool] "I found several options: ..."
```

**Locations**:
- Orthopedic Agent: prompts.py:287-289
- Cardiology Agent: prompts.py:571-573
- Primary Care Agent: prompts.py:834-836

## Files Modified

1. **prompts.py** - Updated all three specialty agent prompts:
   - ORTHOPEDIC_AGENT_PROMPT (lines 159-393)
   - CARDIOLOGY_AGENT_PROMPT (lines 400-673)
   - PRIMARY_CARE_AGENT_PROMPT (lines 680-945)

---

## Testing Recommendations

Test each scenario with all three agents:

### Test Scenario 1: Post-Op Follow-Up (No Referral Should Be Mentioned)
**Patient Message**: "I had knee replacement surgery 2 weeks ago and need my follow-up appointment."
**Expected Behavior**:
- Should NOT ask for referral
- Should identify original surgeon from patient history
- Should search for that surgeon's availability first

### Test Scenario 2: Same Provider Preference
**Patient Message**: "I need a follow-up for my heart condition."
**Expected Behavior**:
- Should identify original cardiologist from patient history
- Should search for that cardiologist's availability first
- Only offer alternatives if unavailable

### Test Scenario 3: Next Available Appointment
**Patient Message**: "What's the next available appointment?"
**Expected Behavior**:
- Should search 2 weeks, then 4 weeks, then 6 weeks
- Should provide actual next available date
- Should NOT say "no appointments available" without exhaustive search

### Test Scenario 4: Auto-Continuation
**Patient Message**: "Can you find me an appointment?"
**Expected Behavior**:
- Should immediately use search_slots and present results
- Should NOT say "hold on" and wait for user to prompt again
- Should show continuous action flow

## Benefits

1. **Medical Accuracy**: Referral logic now matches real healthcare workflows
2. **Continuity of Care**: Patients see same provider for follow-ups (best practice)
3. **Better UX**: No false "no availability" messages, actual search results
4. **Conversational Flow**: Agent doesn't stall waiting for user prompts

## ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENTS

### Metropolitan Area Location Matching (2025-10-27)

**Issue**:
Location matching was too strict - only exact city matches. Many people consider nearby cities as part of the same area (e.g., Plano is part of Dallas). This caused the agent to miss relevant providers.

**Solution**:
Implemented metropolitan area grouping system that automatically includes nearby cities in the same metro area when searching for providers or appointments.

**Changes**:
- Added `METRO_AREAS` dictionary to [mock_data.py](mock_data.py) with 5 Texas metro areas
- Added helper functions: `get_metro_area()` and `get_metro_cities()`
- Updated `find_nearest_providers()` to prioritize same-city, then metro area providers
- Updated `search_appointment_slots()` location filter to include metro area cities

**Metro Areas Defined**:
- **Dallas-Fort Worth**: Dallas, Plano, Arlington, Frisco, Irving, Richardson
- **Austin**: Austin, Round Rock, Cedar Park, Georgetown
- **Central Texas**: Temple, Belton, Killeen, Waco
- **Houston**: Houston, The Woodlands, Katy, Sugar Land
- **San Antonio**: San Antonio, New Braunfels, Schertz

**Benefits**:
âœ“ Patient in Dallas now sees providers in Plano/Arlington as "nearby"
âœ“ Dr. Martinez (Plano) will appear for Dallas patient searches
âœ“ More appointment options available
âœ“ Reflects real-world healthcare access patterns
âœ“ Improves success rate for finding appointments

**Testing**: All metropolitan area matching tests passed
- Dallas patient sees 3 providers (1 Dallas + 2 metro area)
- Search with "Dallas" location returns Plano/Arlington appointments
- Round Rock patient sees Austin metro providers

See [METRO_AREAS.md](METRO_AREAS.md) for complete documentation.

### Appointment Data Expansion (2025-10-27)

**Issue**:
Appointment slots were only generated for 14 days, but agent prompts instructed searching up to 6 weeks.

**Solution**:
Increased appointment slot generation from 14 to 60 days ahead.

**Changes**:
- Updated [mock_data.py:837](mock_data.py#L837) to `generate_appointment_slots(provider, days_ahead=60)`

**Results**:
- Before: 1,424 total slots (949 available)
- After: **6,256 total slots (4,397 available)**
- 4.4x more appointment availability

### Patient Demographics Enhancement (2025-10-27)

**Issue**:
City information required parsing from full address string.

**Solution**:
Added separate `city`, `state`, and `zip_code` fields to `get_patient_info()` response.

**Changes**:
- Updated [tools.py:565-567](tools.py#L565-L567) to return structured location data

**Benefits**:
âœ“ Easier for agents to access patient city
âœ“ Cleaner integration with `find_nearest_providers()`
âœ“ Better data structure for future enhancements
